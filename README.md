The Owlery library provides .NET Core developers the ability to consume and
publish to RabbitMQ queues with the same ease as creating a new ApiController.

# Examples

The following are a few examples of how Owlery can help you.

## Defining queue consumers

The following is added in the `ConfigureServices`  method in the `Startup.cs` 
file.

```C#
using Owlery.Extensions;

...

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRabbitControllers();
    ...
}
```

Then we create two consumers in a controller class. The `textConsumer` method
consumes messages from the `tester.test` queue and creates a new instance of the
`AModel` class. This is then published to the `tester.another.test` queue via
the `testExc` exchange. The `anotherTestConsumer` method consumes messages for
`tester.another.test` and logs the `AModel` instances it recieves.

```C#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Owlery;

[RabbitController]
public class OwleryController
{
    private readonly ILogger logger;

    public OwleryController(ILogger<OwleryController> logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    [RabbitConsumer(queueName: "tester.test")]
    [RabbitPublisher(routingKey: "tester.another.test")]
    public AModel testConsumer()
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Creating model");
        return new AModel {
            AnInteger = 99,
            AString = "This is a string",
        };
    }

    [RabbitConsumer(queueName: "tester.another.test")]
    public void anotherTestConsumer([FromBody] AModel aModel)
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Received a model {aModel}");
    }
}

public class AModel
{
    public int AnInteger { get; set; }
    public string AString { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"[AModel AnInteger: {this.AnInteger}, AString: {this.AString}]";
    }
}
```

## Publishing to an exchange

To publish a message to an exchange Dependency Injection is used. First we
require the IRabbitService in the constructor.

```C#
using Owlery.Services;

...

private readonly IRabbitService rabbitService;

public ClassConstructor(
    IRabbitService rabbitService)
{
    this.rabbitService = rabbitService;
}
```

Then we can use the `Publish` method to publish the message

```C#
this.rabbitService.Publish(body: "Message body", routingKey: "tester.test", exchange: "");
```

But we can use any JSONSerializable object as the body, or an array of bytes directly.

If we need to apply any custom properties to the message being published we can
pass a `RabbitMessage` to the `Publish` method. The following is an example of
how to apply custom headers to a message:

```C#
RabbitMessage message = new RabbitMessage {
    Body = "Message body",
    Headers = new Dictionary<string, object> {
        {"x-origin", "Origin of message"},
    },
};

this.rabbitService.Publish(message, "tester.test");
```

## Declaring queues

Automatically declare queues, exchanges and bind queues to exchanges when the 
application starts using configuration only.

In `appsettings.json` or any other configuration source define the following

```json
{
  ...
  "Owlery": {
    "Queues": {
      "TestQueue": {
        "QueueName": "tester.test"
      },
      "AnotherQueue": {
        "QueueName": "tester.another.test"
      }
    },
    "Exchanges": {
      "AnExchange": {
        "ExchangeName": "testExc"
      }
    },
    "Bindings": {
      "ABinding": {
        "QueueName": "tester.another.test",
        "ExchangeName": "testExc",
        "RoutingKey": "tester.routingKey"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following is added in the `ConfigureServices`  method in the `Startup.cs` 
file.

```C#
using Owlery.Extensions;

...

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRabbitControllers(Configuration.GetSection("Owlery"));
    ...
}
```

## Using names and keys defined in configuration

We can use queue and exchange names as well as routing keys defined in configuration.
If we assume the config is defined as it is in the Declaring queues section then
the following works.

```C#
[RabbitConsumer(queueName: "{Owlery:Queues:TestQueue:QueueName}")]
[RabbitPublisher(routingKey: "{Owlery:Bindings:ABinding:RoutingKey}", exchangeName: "{Owlery:Bindings:ABinding:ExchangeName}")]
```

We can of course reference any settings key. For example with the following configuration
and consumer definition.

```json
{
  "MyQueueSettings": {
    "Queue": "name.of.queue"
  }
}
```

```C#
[RabbitConsumer(queueName: "{MyQueueSettings:Queue}")]
```
